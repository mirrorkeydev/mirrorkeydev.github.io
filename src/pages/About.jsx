        Hello! My name is Melanie, and I'm a junior at Oregon State University
        studying CS.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the school year, I work at OSU's Center for Applied
        Systems and Software, writing software for the
        Oregon Department of Transportation and the Linux Foundation. Last summer
        I was a STEP intern at Google, and next summer I'll be returning as a SWE intern.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like taking care of my houseplants, attempting art, mending my
        possessions, and low-stakes hiking.
